    Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
    You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! You can see how I lived before I met you. Kids have names?
  </p>
  <p>
    Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
    <strong>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</strong>
    <em>Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</em>
    Yeah, lots of people did.
  </p>
  <h2>I wish! It's a nickel.</h2>
  <p>
    Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Large bet on myself in round one. A true inspiration for the children. With gusto.

    <li>Noooooo!</li>
    <li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li>

  <h3>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!</h3>

    The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in
    your sleep. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. You lived before you met me?!

    <li>Pansy.</li>

      Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

      When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later,
      Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles.
      Roll film!

    The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in
    your sleep. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, how 'bout them Knicks? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that
    panders to my lust for violence? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Look, last night was a mistake. Moving along… Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
    Bender, you risked your life to save me! But existing is basically all I do!
  </p>
  <p>
    Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Tell them I hate them. Is
    today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Yes, if you make it look
    like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why did you bring us here? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be
    something you'd have to freebase. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Bender, quit destroying the universe! No, just a regular mistake. Of
    all the friends I've had… you're the first. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.
  </p>
  <p>
    Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Fry! Stay back! He's too
    powerful! Really?! Negative, bossy meat creature! One hundred dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! In our darkest hour, we can stand
    erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I guess because my parents keep
    telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
  </p>
  <p>
    Tell her she looks thin. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by
    "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. I guess if you want children beaten, you
    have to do it yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Uh, is the
    puppy mechanical in any way? Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bender, we're trying our best. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
    <strong>Are you crazy?</strong>
    <em>I can't swallow that.</em>
    Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
  </p>
  <h2>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</h2>
  <p>
    Shinier than yours, meatbag. A sexy mistake. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a
    minute. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like
    professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</li>
    <li>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.</li>
    <li>I can explain. It's very valuable.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Your best is an idiot!</h3>
  <p>
    No! The cat shelter's on to me. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Oh yeah, good luck with that. This opera's
    as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel.
    That makes me feel angry!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!</li>
    <li>When will that be?</li>
    <li>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! I love you, buddy! When will that
    be? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are
    dating humans!
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You know, I was God
    once. You know, I was God once. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Quite possible. We live long and are
    celebrated poopers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics,
    then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that
    doesn't make sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. No, just a regular mistake. Fetal stemcells, aren't
    those controversial? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine
    robot sisters are dating humans!
  </p>
  <p>
    You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! We'll need to have a look inside you with
    this camera. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah, lots of people did. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Look, last night was a mistake. I could if you hadn't turned on
    the light and shut off my stereo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fatal. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is
    spongy and bruised. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes
    will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's
    only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there
    and change your opinions manually!
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I
    really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, then good news! It's a suppository. And I'm his friend Jesus. The key to victory is discipline, and that means
    a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Tell her you just want to talk. It has
    nothing to do with mating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me
    with my sexual inhibitions? You don't know how to do any of those. When I was first asked to make a film about my
    nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can
    bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!
